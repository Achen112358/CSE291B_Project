Packed padded sequences are used to tell our RNN to skip over padding tokens in our encoder. Masking explicitly forces the model to ignore certain values, such as attention over padded elements. Both of these techniques are commonly used in NLP. \n","\n","We will also look at how to use our model for inference, by giving it a sentence, seeing what it translates it as and seeing where exactly it pays attention to when translating each word.\n","\n","Finally, we'll use the BLEU metric to measure the quality of our translations.\n","\n","# Task III CopyNet Mechanism\n","\n","## Preparing
